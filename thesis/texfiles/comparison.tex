\chapter{Comparison with Leap Motion system}

\begin{itemize}
\item describe angle extraction with Leap Motion
\item describe recording session
\item known issues of my system
\begin{itemize}
\item as described, sensor values are not good scalable to model...
\item though not so good results...
\item claiming that the difficulty in scaling the measurements is critical...
