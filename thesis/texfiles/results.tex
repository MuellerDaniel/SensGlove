\chapter{Results} \label{cha:results}

\section{Data behaviour / Sensor values} \label{sec:dataRes}

\begin{itemize}
\item general behaviour of sensor (when you get to near, there is a clipping/oversteering)
\item timing behaviour with the earth-mag elimination

\item comparing the calibration methods \\
		$ \rightarrow $ hard-soft as good as Freescale, took Freescale
		$ \rightarrow $ comparison/visualization available in Matlab!
		
\item observations from the earth-mag elimination \\
		$ \rightarrow $ no good results, due to sensor drifts, ...
		$ \rightarrow $ took data with and without cancellation, look at cell 287 in Excel sheet 
		
\item problems with determining the model fit parameters \\
		$ \rightarrow $ tried to find scaling factors on flat surface with known distances (Excel sheet cell 283 ) \\
		$ \rightarrow $ tried to fit it to wooden hand, but there the error is already in the simulated(fitting) data \\
		$ \rightarrow $ tried to derive the position values on the wooden hand, no definite solution found
		$ \rightarrow $ so the fitting is done by a initialization gesture with the hard coded position values
		
\end{itemize}


\section{Pose estimation} \label{sec:estimationRes}

\begin{itemize}
\item results of minimization for simulated data with and without noise
\item results for easy movement (making a fist) with and without noise
\item results for complex movement with and without noise

\item EKF results

\item results with real data
\item as described, sensor values are not good scalable to model...
\item though not so good results...
\item due to timing behaviour of RT minimization, not such a good way to do have a real time estimation
\item so I have results for single magnet - one/multiple sensor 
\item and for multiple magnet - multiple sensor combinations
\item presentation and comparison between EKF and minimizing approach
\item claiming that the difficulty in scaling the measurements is critical...

\end{itemize}
